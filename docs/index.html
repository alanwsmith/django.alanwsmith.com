<p>

Welcome to my Django Tutorial and How

-

Tos

</p>




    
<p>

This site was born out of frustration with the 




offical Django getting started tutorial

<sup><a 
    href="#fnref-1-text"
    id="fnref-1-link"
    >1</a></sup>


.




It doesn't show you how to make a home page. It also skips details on 




how to do user authentication to edit content. 




Those are both fundamental to practial websites 




that Django is great at doing

<sup><a 
    href="#fnref-2-text"
    id="fnref-2-link"
    >2</a></sup>


.




So, I made this tutorail to make it easier to get




started with a site that includes those features. 

</p>




    
<p>

I'm also making a 

<a href="/en/2mneuy3c/?page=django-how-tos">collection of how-tos</a>

<p>

The primary goal of this tutorial is to provide you 




with enough knowledge to make your own Django site that




includes the ability for authorized users to 




create and modify content. 

</p>




    
<p>

The specific things we'll cover include

:

</p>





    

    

    

</section>

<ul class="flow">
    


<li class="flow">



<p>

An overview of Django's built

-

in admin 




interface and user authentication tools

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Creating A Home Page

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Implementing login/logout functionality

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Providing the ability to create, view, update, 




and delete content based on if a user is logged




in or not

</p>



</li>



</ul>


<section class="p-section flow">


      
        
<p>

We'll cover each of those items with a fair




amount of depth. To keep a balance with the 




amount of detail and the length of




the tutorial there are some limits to what's covered. 




Specifically

:

</p>

      





    


</section>


<ul class="flow">
    


<li class="flow">



<p>

I'm a fan of the "First, make it work. Then, make it pretty"




approach to development. We'll be focusing on the




first part and skipping design and styling for the most 




part. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Details on how to deploy a site to production 




vary greatly depending on where the site is hosted. So, we'll




be sticking with a local development version of the




site.

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Django has offical database support for PostgreSQL,




MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite

<sup><a 
    href="#fnref-3-text"
    id="fnref-3-link"
    >3</a></sup>


. Generally speaking, 




SQLite probably isn't what you'd want to use for a 




production database, but it'll work great for our




purposes since we're working with a local development




environment. The reason for this choice is that




SQLite works without having to do any of the 




software set up that's required for the other databases. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

The requirements for user sign

-

up systems vary grately 




from site to site. We'll be making our users and assigning 




their permissions via the built

-

in admin interface instead




of trying to address that. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Django provides built

-

in tools for automated testing. 




I'm a firm believer in testing, but learning how to do that




adds to the mental overhead. We'll skip that for the time




being to focus on the fundamental site functionality. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Version control is a highly recommended best practice, 




but it's not the focus of this tutorial. If you're already 




familiar with how to use a version control system like Git

<sup><a 
    href="#fnref-4-text"
    id="fnref-4-link"
    >4</a></sup>


, feel free




to make commits as you make progress, but we won't be




specically mentioning it.
