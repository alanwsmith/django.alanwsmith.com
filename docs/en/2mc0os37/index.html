<p>

I've taken multiple runs at the offical Django




Getting Started Tutorial. It's relative long but




after going through it I still don't have a sense




of how to work with Django. This is the list




of problem I have with it that make it hard for




me to use.

<p>

No info on how to build a home page

</p>

<li class="flow">



<p>

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Doesn't show how to protect the content editing pages




behind authentication 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Does things like show "the hard way" only to then




show a different way to do things (e.g. the generic 




views). The tutorial should pick one way and stick 




to it. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

The first page of the tutorial assumes you have




Django installed. If I'm doing a tutorial from 




scratch that should be the first thing. Instead, it




links off to a page that then links off to another




page to show you how to actually do the install. 




It's like throwing a curve ball as the very first thing. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

The first thing it shows is how to make a direct




"HttpResponse" response. This is only used as a stub




and isn't something that's used in the final app. That




means you spend mental overhead on something that isn't




going to be used. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

There's no distinction on what lines are new and what




lines have changed in some of the code snippets. It makes




it easy to miss things like a line changing from

</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Verbose documentation is dropped in directly




that's hard to parse without already knowing




what's going on and before some parts of it




are even used (e.g. the path() stuff in Part 1). 




Better to use explinaions of




just the parts that are being used. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Talking about the specific INSTALLED

_

APPS in the database section




at the start of Part 2 is extra overhead that's not needed for running the 




migration command. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

There's a "For the minimalists" aside in Part 2 about




removing some of the INSTALLED

_

APPS. This is the first 




tutorial and I don't really have an understanding of 




when I'd want to do that and what the ramifications




would be. This is better left out since it's more 




overhead and not something I'm going to do for the 




basic app. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

There's a philosopy section at the start of the models




build out in Part 2. I don't need to know that at this




point. It's enough to just run the commands. Learning




about the philosophy can come later. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

The tutorial builds two models at the same time. It's




better to do one thing at a time. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

The models in Part 2 introduce Foreign key constraints




in the first example. That's a more advanced topic that




should be covered once we have a basic model in place.




This is part of one of my overall feeling that part of this 




tutorial is trying to get you through it as fast as 




possible while sacrificing an incremental approach that




aids in understanding a smaller number of concepts 




at one time. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Talking about the "pluggable" philosophy in the breakout




aside box isn't needed. The break out box makes it feel




like it's a very important thing that I need to know about




to make things work, but that's not the case. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Part 2 runs the command to show the SQL that builds the




database tables. This is unnecessary and can be a lot for




folks that don't have knowledge of SQL. At this point, 




it's enough to know that the table is built. This




is also an example of running an unnecessary command




for making things work. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

The "Playing With The API" section of Part 2 uses the command




line shell to create content. Using the command line




is not something that's required to build the web app. 




This is a lot of extra mental overhead. Unfortunately, 




you can't skip this since the content created here




is what's used later in the tutorial. It's better to




create initial content via the admin interface which is




actually what's shown next. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

The "Playing With The API" section digs into using




primary and foreign keys. That's a lot of overhead




before we've even seen a web page with a basic output




on it. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Part 3 again stubs pages with "HttpResponse" that's




not what we'll actually be using. It also stubs




all the pages and URLS patterns at the same time so




there's a big shift. It's better to add things one




at a time so there's a direct correlation between 




the changes in the code and what you're seeing




at each step. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

The "Write views that actually do something"




is where things should have started. It's a clear




indication that the stuff we did before was just




burning mental energy on things we aren't actually




going to use. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

The first part of the "Write views that actually do something"




section in Part 3 shows how to use the "HttpResponse"




and "loader" modules. Once it's done that, it shows




you how to use the single "render" shortcut instead. 




Again, we've had to spend mental energy learning two




ways to do the same thing. We don't need the first




way for any of the rest of the project so we should




just be introduced to the shortcut at this time and




save the fuller version for when it's necessary. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

The "Raising a 404 error" section of Part 3 does




the same thing where it shows both a verbose way and 




a shortcut for how to handle missing pages. As before,




the tutorial should pick the most common use case




and just show it. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Creating the templates for each of the parts




of the app is pretty far away from the views for each




related item. It's hard to track how they connect to




each other. It would be better to do things one at a time. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Part 3 builds the "detail" page out before it builds




the index page. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

A big issue with the approach in part 3 is you end up 




making a bunch of changes before trying to look at any




pages. That leaves a lot of room to introduce errors and




typos that become very hard to figure out without already




having experience with the error messages. This left




me feeling lost several times and having to backtrack




through lots of changes to try to figure out where I




did something that introduced and error. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

There's a section called "Removing hardcoded URLs in templates"




in Part 3. This is another example of being shown




one way to do something and then having it change later




to the way you'll actually do things. It would be




better to just show the single way and exaplain it fully. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

The "Namespacing URL names" is it's own section in 




Part 3. This should be rolled into the start of the app




since it's something we want to do for the final version. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Part 4 starts by redoing the detail template. We should




have just started here and explained things directly. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Part 4 has a section called "Use generic views

:

 Less code is better"




that talks about using generic views. This is another 




case of being show multiple ways to do the same thing. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

There's a breakout aside called "Why the code

-

shuffle" in 




Part 4 that talks about how you would generally evaluate 




if you want to use a generic view or not when you firest create




a view instea of refactoring halfway through. It then goes on 




to say the tutorial intentionally focuses on "the hard way" to




start with. I'm not concerned with which way is harder or




easier. The core problem is that the tutorial introduces two ways




to do it and, as a beginner, I have no idea how to judge 




which one I should be using. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

The "Amend URLconf" in Part 4 is another example of introducing




multiple changes at the same time. The same goes for the "Amend views"




section. 

</p>



</li>


<li class="flow">



<p>

Part 5 starts automated testing. I'm a big beliver in testing, but




for an initial tutorial I like the idea of stopping with a basic working




site and then breaking testing out to it's own tutorial where you 




can start from scratch and to TDD instead of retro

-

fitting the 




tests into already the already existing code.

One of the hardest parts of writing a good getting 




started tutorial is putting yourself in the 




mind of your intended audience when you yourself are




and expert. There's lots of context already loaded in 




your brain that makes it easy to miss how much mental 




energy it takes to learn each new thing. That, in turn, 




makes it easy to add in way more than you need since




you, as the author, don't feel the weight of trying




to figure every little part out. 

</p>

      

      
        
<p>

It's also easy to ignore the fact that folks will make




typos and errors understanding what needs to change in 




files. When a tutorial makes a bunch of changes before




looking at the work to check it, the chance of introducing




errors that are hard for new folks to track down becomes




huge. 

</p>

      

      
        
<p>

Errors are a way of life. Must tutorials I see don't show




any errors at all. That leaves you with no exporse to them




other than the mistakes you make which aren't addressed




in the tutorial itself. 

</p>

      

      
        
<p>

Taking all that into consideration, had led me to make 




the tutorial on this site that tries to address




those issues. 

</p>

      

      
        
<p>

I hope you find it useful.
