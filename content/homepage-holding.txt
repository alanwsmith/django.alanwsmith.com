Django 5.1 Getting Started Tutorial And How-Tos

-- h2

Introduction

Welcome to my Django Tutorial and How-Tos

This site was born out of frustration with the 
offical Django getting started tutorial^^1^^.
It doesn't show you how to make a home page. It also skips details on 
how to do user authentication to edit content. 
Those are both fundamental to practial websites 
that Django is great at doing^^2^^.
So, I made this tutorail to make it easier to get
started with a site that includes those features. 

I'm also making a <<ilink|collection of how-tos|2mneuy3c>>

You can read more about the tutorial below. Or, jump straight
into it here if you want to get started right away:

Who This Tutorial Is For

This tutorial is desinged for:

-- list

- Folks who have never worked with Django before 

- Folks who are frustrated with other tutorials not
giving them enough information to make a basic site
with Django's core features

-- p

There are a few prerequisites you'll need to know in 
order to get started:

-- list

- A code editor (like <<link|VS Code|https://code.visualstudio.com/>>)

- An installed version of <<link|Python 3|https://www.python.org/>>

- A basic knowledge of working with the Python
programming langauge

- A basic knowledge of how to run commands on 
a terminal command line

- A baisc knowledge of HTML

Goals

The primary goal of this tutorial is to provide you 
with enough knowledge to make your own Django site that
includes the ability for authorized users to 
create and modify content. 

The specific things we'll cover include:

-- list

- An overview of Django's built-in admin 
interface and user authentication tools

- Creating A Home Page

- Implementing login/logout functionality

- Providing the ability to create, view, update, 
and delete content based on if a user is logged
in or not

-- p

We'll cover each of those items with a fair
amount of depth. To keep a balance with the 
amount of detail and the length of
the tutorial there are some limits to what's covered. 
Specifically:

-- list

- I'm a fan of the "First, make it work. Then, make it pretty"
approach to development. We'll be focusing on the
first part and skipping design and styling for the most 
part. 

- Details on how to deploy a site to production 
vary greatly depending on where the site is hosted. So, we'll
be sticking with a local development version of the
site.

- Django has offical database support for PostgreSQL,
MariaDB, MySQL, Oracle, and SQLite^^3^^. Generally speaking, 
SQLite probably isn't what you'd want to use for a 
production database, but it'll work great for our
purposes since we're working with a local development
environment. The reason for this choice is that
SQLite works without having to do any of the 
software set up that's required for the other databases. 

- The requirements for user sign-up systems vary grately 
from site to site. We'll be making our users and assigning 
their permissions via the built-in admin interface instead
of trying to address that. 

- Django provides built-in tools for automated testing. 
I'm a firm believer in testing, but learning how to do that
adds to the mental overhead. We'll skip that for the time
being to focus on the fundamental site functionality. 

- Version control is a highly recommended best practice, 
but it's not the focus of this tutorial. If you're already 
familiar with how to use a version control system like Git^^4^^, feel free
to make commits as you make progress, but we won't be
specically mentioning it.

This is the offical getting started tutofial from the Django
project. It may work for other folks, but it doesn't for me. 
Hence the reason I made this site.
